# We will store all critical dates for all past years, and years
# up to some point in the future. Critical dates past that year
# will be calculated on the fly.  $keep_years is the number of
# years in the future which will be kept explicitly.
#
# This ensures that years in the near future can be accessed quickly,
# and that all years past a threshold are assumed to be static
# (with respect to how critical dates are calculated).
#
# This is the number of years in the future to keep. For testing
# purposes, we'll compare years beyond that to make sure that the
# critical dates are constant. This value ($test_years) must be
# greater than $keep_years.
