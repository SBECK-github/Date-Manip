=head1 NAME

Date::Manip::Changes5 - changes in Date::Manip 5.xx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This describes the changes made to the Date::Manip module up to the
time that 6.00 was released.  Because 6.00 required a newer version
of perl (5.10 or higher), the old version was maintained.

When Date::Manip 6.10 was released, both versions were bundled
together (though how it was bundled changed when 6.14 was released).

This document describes all changes made to the old version of
Date::Manip.

For the most part, Date::Manip has remained backward compatible at
every release, but occasionally, a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).

=head1 VERSION 5.66 (Released with 6.51)

=over 4

=item Fixed a bug in Date_ConvTZ

Applied a patch supplied by Zhenyi Zhou which fixes a bug in Date_ConvTZ
where passing in an empty string did not work.

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.65 (Released with 6.37)

As of December 2012, Version 5 of Date::Manip will no longer be modified.
The 5.xx version was updated to 5.65 (but no changes were made), and this
version is expected to be the final release in the 5.xx series.

The one exception is that if someone submits a patch that applies cleanly
and causes zero failures in the test suite, I will consider adding it on
a case-by-cast bases.

Please use Date::Manip 6.xx instead.

=head1 VERSION 5.64 (Released with 6.32)

=over 4

=item Better handling of '0000' timezone

Applied a patch supplied by Ed Avis that improves handling of the '0000' timezone..

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.63 (Released with 6.26)

=over 4

=item Fixed business mode calculation

Applied a patch that I received some time ago to fix a business
mode calculation.  Steve Tempest

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.62 (Released with 6.21)

No changes

=head1 VERSION 5.61 (Released with 6.20)

No changes

=head1 VERSION 5.60 (Released with 6.14)

=over 4

=item B<Fully integrated with 6.xx>

As of Date::Manip 6.14, the 5.xx release is fully integrated into the
distribution. Both will be installed automatically and you can switch
between them (if you have a recent version of perl). This simplifies
the package management process considerably. The downside is that
Date::Manip 6.xx will be installed, even if you do not have a recent
version of perl and cannot use it.

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.59 (Released with 6.12)

=over 4

=item Test fixes

Fix tests to work better on windows.

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.58 (Released with 6.11)

=over 4

=item Test fixes

Fixed a bug in some of the tests that were causing two tests to
fail.  JD

Explicitly set TZ in all tests to avoid some failures (it got left out
of a few when it was bundled with 6.10).

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.57 (Released with 6.10)

=over 4

=item B<(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx>

As of 6.10, Date-Manip-6.xx will contain both the Date::Manip 5.xx and
6.xx modules. If perl 5.10 or higher is available, the 6.xx version
will be installed. For older versions of perl, the 5.xx version will
be installed.

This will allow all of the automatic module tools to work correctly.

=head1 VERSION 5.43 (DEVELOPMENT)

=over 4

=item B<(!) (*) Recurrences revisited>

The behavior of some elements of recurrences changed. These included
making the week element (N) refer to the Nth occurrence of a day of the
week in the week, month, or year. It is now possible to look at the
3rd Friday of every month for example.

Y-0-WOY-DOW now refers to the WOY'th occurrence of DOW instead of the
ISO 8601 date Y-W(WOY)-DOY. Also, changed Y-0-WOY-0 to refer to the
WOY'th occurrence of FirstDay, and got rid of the MW and MD flags. Many
other similar changes.

=item B<(!) Changed %x format in UnixDate>

The %x format used to be equivalent to %D (%m/%d/%y), but it has
been modified to use the DateFormat config variable, so it may return
%d/%m/%y if a non-US DateFormat is specified.

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.41 (DEVELOPMENT)

As of 5.41, odd numbered releases are development (and appear only on
my page). Even number releases are official releases submitted to
CPAN.

=over 4

=item B<(!) Changed path separator for VMS>

Since ":" is used in some VMS paths, it should not have been used as
the path separator.  It has been changed to a newline ("\n") character.

=item B<(!) Delta_Format behavior changed>

The entire delta is exact if no month component is present
(previously, no year or month component could be present).  Due to

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.35 (1999-07-06)

=over 4

=item B<(!) Deprecated Date_DaysSince999>

In fixing support for the years 0001-0999, I rewrote Date_DaysSince999 to
be Date_DaysSince1BC.  The Date_DaysSince999 function will be removed.

=item B<(*) (!) Added PathSep variable>

In order to better support Win32 platforms, I added the PathSep config
variable.  This will allow the use of paths such as "c:\date" on Win32
platforms.  Old config files on Win32 platforms (which were not working
correctly in many cases) may not work if they contain path information to
the personal config file.

=item B<(*) Recurrences now support flags>

Flags for modifying recurrence dates are now supported.

=item B<(*) Improved holiday support considerably>

Added support for recurrences and one-year-only holidays (the latter
requested first by Vishal Bhatia.

=item B<(*) Date_Init improved>

Date_Init can now return a list of config variables if called in array
context.  Based on a suggestion by Matt Tuttle.

=item New features

Modified Date_GetPrev/Date_GetNext to take $curr=2.

Now parses the Apache log file format "dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss (time zone)".

Added Date_IsHoliday routine.  Joe Pepin

Added recurrence support for Easter (first suggested by Abigail).

Made "epoch" not case sensitive and fixed a bug where it would fail in
some languages.  Caught because of Iosif's thorough Romanian test file.

Fixed a problem where "in 5 days/weeks/months" sometimes wouldn't get
correctly parsed in other languages.  Caught because of Iosif's
thorough Romanian test file.

Fixed a weakness in ParseDateDelta brought out by the Romanian delta
test file.

Fixed a bug causing warnings in the beta version of perl.  Patch by
Paul Johnson.

Fixed support for years 0000-0999.  Requested by Chris Vaughan

Several recurrence bug fixes.

New recurrence documentation.

=back

=head1 VERSION 5.34 (1999-04-13)

=over 4

=item B<(!) (*) All Date::Manip variables are no longer accessible>

Previously, Date::Manip variables were declared using a full package
name.  Now, they are declared with the my() function.  This means that
internal variables are no longer accessible outside of the module.
Based on suggestion by Tom Christiansen

=item B<(!) Week interpretation in business mode deltas>

A business mode delta containing a week value used to be treated as 7 days.
A much more likely interpretation of a week is Monday to Monday, regardless
of holidays, so this is now the behavior.

=item B<(!) %z UnixDate format>

The %z UnixDate format used to return the time zone abbreviation.  It now
returns it as a GMT offset (i.e. -0500).  %Z still returns the time zone
abbreviation.  Suggested by Tuc.

=item B<(!) Formats "22nd Sunday" returns the intuitive value>

The date "22nd Sunday" used to return the Sunday of the 22nd week of the
year (which could be the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd Sunday of the year depending
on how weeks were defined).  Now, it returns the 22nd Sunday of the year
regardless.

=item B<(!) Separator in DD/YYmmm and mmmDD/YY formats no longer optional>

Previously, the date "Dec1065" would return Dec 10, 1965.  After
adding the YYYYmmm and mmmYYYY formats, this was no longer possible.
The separator between DD and YY is no longer optional, so

   Dec1065     returns December 1, 1065
   Dec10/65    returns December 10, 1965

=item B<(*) Date_Cmp added>

In one of the next versions of Date::Manip, the internal format of the
date will change to include time zone information.  All date
comparisons should be made using Date_Cmp (which currently does
nothing more than call the Perl "cmp" command, but which will
important when comparing dates that include the time zone).

Added now in response to a question by Al Sorrell (I should have added
it earlier).

=item New features

Added exact business mode.  Ian Duplisse

Added "mmmYYYY" and "YYYYmmm" formats.  As a result, "DDYYmmm" and
"mmmDDYY" formats changed to "DD/YYmmm" and "mmmDD/YY" as described
above.  David Twomey

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where a date passed in as an array wasn't getting the
date removed from the array.  Rick Wise

Added tests for MPE/iX OS.  John Testa

Fixed a bug where WorkDayBeg=8:00 went into an infinite loop.
Mark Martinec

Changed a business week to be the same as an exact week.  Abigail

Fixed a bug where "Sunday week 0" didn't work (only affected week 0)
Gerald Rinske

Minor bug (my variable declared twice).  Paul J. Schinder

Fixed a bug where "epoch SECONDS" was getting parsed wrong (for SECONDS
which could be interpreted as an ISO-8601 date).  N. Thomas

Fixed a problem where init files were not being read.  Mike Reetz

=item Time zone fixes

At the request of the UN, I added the SAT time zone.  :-) Howard
Hendler

Fixed a bug where time zones were converted multiple times if ConvTZ

=head1 VERSION 5.33 (1998-08-20)

=over 4

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where "1 month ago" was no longer working (and added it to
the test cases).  This broke when I fixed the "-1second" bug in the
previous version.  A result of this is that a number of "deltas" can
be parsed as dates (i.e. &ParseDate("1 hour 20 minutes ago") is
equivalent to &DateCalc("now","1 hour 20 minutes ago")).  Only text
deltas can be used in this way (i.e. &ParseDate("-0:0:0:0:1:20:0")
will not work).

=item Language fixes

Added Spanish support.  Bautista Jasso Javier

=item B<(!) Date_Init arguments>

The old style Date_Init arguments that were deprecated in version 5.07
have been removed.

=item B<(!) (*) DateManip.cnf change>

Changed .DateManip.cnf to Manip.cnf (to get rid of problems on OS's
that insist on 8.3 filenames) for all non-Unix platforms (Windows, VMS,
Mac).  For all Unix platforms, it's still .DateManip.cnf .  It will only
look in the user's home directory on VMS and Unix.

=item New features

Added "in N days" and "N days ago" formats.  Tony Bowden.

Added cYYYY format to YYtoYYYY variable.  Mark Rejhon.

Added 2 days/weeks/months later in both ParseDate and ParseDelta (for
Dutch support).  Abigail.

Added "Y:M:0*-DOM:0:0:0" to ParseRecur.  Jeff Yoak.

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where the deltas could be off by up to a couple minutes in
some rare cases.  Herman Horsten.

Fixed an "uninitialized symbol" warning.  Mark D. Anderson.

Fixed a bug where holidays weren't erased.  Jonathan Wright.

Applied a bug fix from Joe Chapman where the %W/%U UnixDate formats
were frequently wrong.

Several minor fixes and improvements.  Abigail.

Added some VMS support.  Charles Lane.

Fixed a bug which caused a test to fail on some systems.  Charles Lane.

Fixed a bug where "-1second" was treated as a date rather than a delta
in DateCalc.  Kenneth Ingham

Added a bit to the Makefile.PL (as it was distributed in the Win32
Perl Resource Kit).  Murray Nesbitt

=item Time zone fixes

Allowed time zones of the format STD-#DST-#.  Peter Gordon.

Added time zone support for "+0500 (EST)".  Tom Christiansen.

Restricted time zones parsing to 0000-2359 instead of 0000-9999.
Frank Cusack

Added time zones.  W. Phillip Moore, Michael Smith, Samuli Karkkainen

=item B<(!) Long running processes may give incorrect time zone>

A process that runs during a time zone change (Daylight Saving Time
specifically) may report the wrong time zone.  See the UpdateCurrTZ variable
for more information.

=item B<(!) UnixDate "%J", "%W", and "%U" formats fixed>

The %J, %W, and %U will no longer report a week 0 or a week 53 if it should
really be week 1 of the following year.  They now report the correct week
number according to ISO 8601.

=item New features

Added YYtoYYYY variable.  Suggested by Michel van der List.

=head1 VERSION 5.20 (1997-10-12)

=over 4

=item B<(*) ISO 8601 support>

ISO 8601 dates are now parsed. This resulted in several other
changes specified below.

=item B<(!) (*) ParseDate formats removed>

As a result of ISO 8601 support, some formats which previously worked
may no longer be parsed since they conflict with an ISO 8601 format.
These include MM-DD-YY (conflicts with YY-MM-DD) and YYMMDD (conflicts
with YYYYMM).  MM/DD/YY still works, so the first form can be kept
easily by changing "-" to "/".  YYMMDD can be changed to YY-MM-DD
before being parsed.  Whenever parsing dates using dashes as
separators, they will be treated as ISO 8601 dates.  You can get
around this by converting all dashes to slashes.

=item B<(!) (*) Week day numbering>

The day numbering was changed from 0-6 (Sun-Sat) to 1-7 (Mon-Sun) to be
ISO 8601 compatible.  Weeks start on Monday (though this can be overridden
using the FirstDay config variable) and the 1st week of the year contains
Jan 4 (though it can be forced to contain Jan 1 with the Jan1Week1 config
variable).

=item New features

Several new parsing formats added, including:
   "Friday"             suggested by Rob Perelman
   "12th"               suggested by Rob Perelman
   "last day of MONTH"  suggested by Chadd Westhoff

Added ParseDateString for speed (and simplicity for modifying ParseDate)

Added %J and %K formats to UnixDate.

Added Date_DaysInMonth.

=item Bug fixes

Reorganized ParseDate more efficiently.

Fixed some incorrect uses of $in instead of $future in ParseDate.
Thanks to Erik Corry.

Added some speedups (more to come).

=item Test fixes

Cleaned up testing mechanism a bit and added tests for ISO 8601 formats.

Fixed a bug which showed up in French dates (though it could happen in
other languages as well).  Thanks to Georges Martin.

Fixed a bug in DateCalc.  Thanks to Thomas Winzig.

Removed the "eval" statement from CheckFilePath which causes a suid
c wrapper program to die when it calls a Date::Manip script.
Thanks to Hank Hughes.

Fixed a bug in business mode calculations.  Thanks to Sterling Swartwout.

Fixed a bug in which "1997023100:00:00" was accepted as valid.  Thanks
to Doug Emerald.

Cleaned up checks for MacOS and Microsoft OS's.  Hopefully I'm catching
everything.  Thanks to Charlie Wu for one more check.

Fixed a typo which broke Time%Date (Date=dd%mmm%yy) format.  Thanks to
Timothy Kimball.

=item Time zone fixes

Fixed some problems with how "US/Eastern" type time zones were used.
Thanks to Marvin Solomon.

=item Test fixes

Tests will now run regardless of the time zone you are in.

Test will always read the DateManip.cnf file in t/ now.

A failed test will now give slightly more information.

DateManip.cnf file in t/ now sets ALL options to override any changes
made in the Manip.pm file.

=item Documentation fixes

Added documentation for backwards incompatibilities to POD.

Fixed some problems in POD documentation.  Thanks to Marvin Solomon.

Fixed minor POD error pointed out by John Perkins.

Changed documentation for Date_IsWorkDay (it was quite confusing using
a variable named $time).  Thanks to Erik M. Schwartz.

=head1 VERSION 5.07 (1996-12-10)

=over 4

=item B<(!) UnixDate "%s" format>

Used to return the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 in the current
time zone.  It now returns the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 GMT.
The "%o" format was added which returns what "%s" previously did.

=item B<(!) (*) Internal format of delta>

The format for the deltas returned by ParseDateDelta changed.  Previously,
each element of a delta had a sign attached to it (+1:+2:+3:+4:+5:+6).  The
new format removes all unnecessary signs by default (+1:2:3:4:5:6).  Also,
because of the way deltas are normalized (see documentation on
ParseDateDelta), at most two signs are included.  For backwards
compatibility, the config variable DeltaSigns was added.  If set to 1, all
deltas include all 6 signs.

=item B<(!) (*) Date_Init arguments>

The format of the Date_Init calling arguments changed.  The
old method

   Date_Init($language,$format,$tz,$convtz);

is still supported , but this support will likely disappear in the future.
Use the new calling format instead:

   Date_Init("var=val","var=val",...);

NOTE:  The old format is no longer supported as of version 5.32 .

=item B<(*) Added weeks to ParseDateDelta.>

Suggested by Mike Bassman.  Note that since this is a late addition, I
did not change the internal format of a delta.  Instead, it is added
to the days field.

=item B<(*) Now reads a config file.>

Refer to the Date_Init documentation for details.

=item B<(*) Added business mode.>

See documentation.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.

=item New features

B<(*) Modified how deltas are normalized and added the DeltaSigns config
variable.>

Added %q format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman.
Also added %P format "YYYYMMDDHH:MM:SS".

Added a new config variable to allow you to work with multiple internal
formats (with and without colons).  Requested by Rob Perelman.
See Date_Init documentation.

Added the following formats suggested by Andreas Johansson:
   Sunday week 22 [in 1996] [at 12:00]
   22nd Sunday [in 1996] [at 12:00]
   Sunday 22nd week [in 1996] [at 12:00]

Added a new config variable to allow you to define the first day of
the week.  See Date_Init documentation.

Added the following formats to ParseDate for convenience (some were
suggested by Mike Bassman):
   next/last Friday [at time]
   next/last week [at time]
   in 2 weeks [at time]
   2 weeks ago [at time]
   Friday in 2 weeks
   in 2 weeks on Friday
   Friday 2 weeks ago
   2 weeks ago Friday

Added Date_SecsSince1970GMT, moved the %s format to %o (secs since 1/1/70)
and added %s format (secs since 1/1/70 GMT).  Based on suggestions by
Mark Osbourne.  Note this introduces a minor backward incompatibility
described above.

Date_SetTime now works with international time separators.

Added the %g format (%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z) for an RFC 1123 date.
Suggested by Are Bryne.

Added options to delete existing holidays and ignore global config file.

Date_GetNext and Date_GetPrev now return the next/prev occurrence of a
time as well as a day.  Suggested by Are Bryne.

In approximate mode, deltas now come out completely normalized (only 1
sign).  Suggested by Rob Perelman.

Added Date::Manip::InitDone so initialization isn't duplicated.

Added a 3rd internal format to store YYYY-MM-DD HH:MN:SS (iso 8601).

Added a config variable to allow you to work with 24 hour business
days.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.

ParseDateDelta now returns "" rather than "+0:0:0:0:0:0" when there is
an error.

=item Bug fixes

B<(*) The d:h:mn:s of ALL deltas are normalized.>

Huge number of code changes to clean things up.

Subroutines now check to see if 4 digit years are entered.  Suggested
by Are Bryne.

Added local($_) to all routines which use $_.  Suggested by Rob
Perelman.

Complete rewrite of DateCalc.

Fixed a bug where UnixDate %E format didn't work with single digit
dates.  Patch supplied by Jyrgen Nyrgaard.

Fixed a bug where "today" was not converted to the correct time zone.

=item Time zone fixes

Fixed bug in Date_TimeZone where it didn't recognize +HHMN type time
zones.  Thanks to Are Bryne.

Added WindowsNT check to Date_TimeZone to get around NT's weird date
command.  Thanks to Are Bryne.

Fixed typo (CSD instead of CST).

Fixed sign in military time zones making Date::Manip RFC 1123 compliant
(except that time zone information is not stored in any format)

(thanks to Ric Steinberger).

Fixed a bug where fractional seconds weren't parsed correctly.

Fixed a bug where "noon" and other special times were not parsed
in the "which day of month" formats.

Fixed a minor bug where a few matches were case sensitive.

The command "date +%Z" doesn't work on SunOS machines (and perhaps
others) so 5.05 is effectively broken.  5.06 released to fix this.

=item Bug fixes

Fixed bug introduced in 5.04 when default day set to 1.  When no
date given, have day default to today rather than 1.  It only
defaults to one if a partial date is given.

Fixed bug where Date_DaysSince999 returned the wrong value (the
error did not affect any other functions in Date::Manip due to
the way it was called and the nature of the error).  Pointed out
by Jason Baker

Dates with commas in them are now read properly.

Fixed two places where a variable was declared twice using my (thanks
to Ric Steinberger).

Hopefully fixed installation problems.

Got rid of the last (I think) couple of US specific strings.
