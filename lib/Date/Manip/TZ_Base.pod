=head1 NAME

Date::Manip::TZ_Base - Methods common to the TZ and Base classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Date::Manip::TZ_Base class is a second base class used for the
following Date::Manip classes:

=over 4

=item L<Date::Manip::Base>

=item L<Date::Manip::TZ>

=back

This module is not intended to be called directly and performs no
useful function by itself. Instead, use the various derived classes
which inherit from it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains no public methods and is used internally by
the Base and TZ classes. In some instances, basic date operations
depend on timezone information, and all timezone operations depend
on the base class.  In order to avoid a circular dependency, I created
this class which allowed me to avoid that.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND QUESTIONS
