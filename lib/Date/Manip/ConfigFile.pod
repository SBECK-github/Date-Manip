Date::Manip::ConfigFile - sample config file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Manip is a highly configurable module.  Many of the options
can be set in a config file.  This document includes a sample config
file.

The config file consists of three sections.  The first section is
config variables.  This is described more fully in the L<Date::Manip::Config>
document.

The second section is the holiday definition section.  The third section
is the event definition section.  These are both described more fully
in the L<Date::Manip::Holidays> document.

=head1 SAMPLE CONFIG FILE

The sample config file below works for newer versions of Date::Manip.
Some of the config variables may change, or be deprecated, and some
may not work with earlier versions of Date::Manip, so it is strongly
suggested that you check out the documentation for the version of
Date::Manip you are using to confirm any of the config variables you
want to include.
